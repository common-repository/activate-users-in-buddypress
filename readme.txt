    == Description ==
	
	This plug-in is intended to assist developers in making sure all previous wordpress users have been correctly pulled into Buddypress. This very simple plug-in checks for the key user meta fields (X Profile, BP Activity, and Last Activity), provides a list of all your user and a legend as to which META exists. If any information is missing, a button enables administration to bring users into the BP member arena by adding these key fields. This plug-in is intended for migration from older version of Wordpress & Buddypress where due to anomolies user meta has not been added correctly.
